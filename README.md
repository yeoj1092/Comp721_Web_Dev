# Web Development
This repository contains lab work completed over a 10-week period for a web development course. The projects employ PHP, HTML, and myPHPAdmin as the database.

## Technologies Used
- PHP
- HTML
- myPHPAdmin
## Features
- Multiple projects with various functionality
- Use of database connectivity and manipulation through myPHPAdmin and PHP
- Use of HTML for web page structure and layout
## Known Issues
- The first lab was not written in hack, despite the fact that it is registered as hack code. The code is secure to use; there was a labelling mistake.
- The projects contained in this repository were finished at a particular time, so they might not be entirely compatible with more recent iterations of the employed technologies. Before using the code in a production environment, some testing might be necessary.
## Usage
- Set up a development environment with PHP and myPHPAdmin installed
- Import the database schemas provided into myPHPAdmin
- Run the PHP files on a server to use and test the project functionality
